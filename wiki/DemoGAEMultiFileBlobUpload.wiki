= Demo GAE Multi Batch File Blob Upload =
 This project is an example of using an japplet to process a directory and get the files and send them back to the gwt with JSNI javascript. We can communicate to the applet using javascript and back to javascript from the java. Although, I saved time and self signed the japplet to get this demo out the door. Check the war folder of GAE_FIleUpload for the signing instructions and other stuff. This is still in the works.

= Demo =
 * [http://demogaemultifileblobupload.appspot.com/ Demo] - Multi upload demo is partially disabled b/c one could upload hundreds of files.
 * [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-examples/source/browse/#svn/trunk/GAE_FileUpload/src/com/gonevertical/upload Applet Source] - Directory Chooser for GWT
 * [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-examples/source/browse/#svn/trunk/DemoGAEMultiFileUpload GWT Project Source] - GWT Project source, using the file directory chooser

==First Try==
 I used the applet to get the files recursively in the directories tree and then sent those back from the applet to the javascript GWT application to process, although I didn't realized the file input was read only and setting the value wasn't possible, at least easily and with out security risks. 

==Second Try==
 I then moved the entire upload process to the applet including getting the blob url. I setup a blob url servlet so I could get the url for the upload. Then I use Apache commons HttpClient,HttpCore,HttpMime libraries to do the uploading of the file which works great. This app is just an example, so all the security measures are not implemented so to try out the process.

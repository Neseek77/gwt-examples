#summary Quick Tips about how things work

= Quick Tips =
 Quick tips that might help you. These are things that I have learned along the way that make my job easier.

== Console/Syslog Debugging ==
 Using System.out.println to print to debugger console or when running it on the server it will print to the /var/log/Syslog which is very helpful for debugging.
{{{
System.out.println("MyMethod has this var: " + this.MyVar);
}}}

== Print RPCs Serialized Response ==
 I found this in GWT sample Dynamic Table. I love this function b/c it prints out the object that will be sent in the RPC. Put this snippet in your server side of the rpc call, MyServerImpl.java class. 
{{{
//stick this in your server side, MyServiceImpl.java class
/**
 * Write the serialized response out to stdout. This is a very unusual thing
 * to do, but it allows us to create a static file version of the response
 * without deploying a servlet.
 */
protected void onAfterResponseSerialized(String serializedResponse) {
  System.out.println(serializedResponse);
}
}}}

== Image ==
 Show an external image on your page.
{{{
//stick the image in the ~/www folder
HorizontalPanel loading = new HorizontalPanel();
String sImage = GWT.getModuleBaseURL() + "loading2.gif";
Image image = new Image(sImage);
pLoadingStatus.add(image);
}}}

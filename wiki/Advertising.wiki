 === Why I Use AdBrite ===
 Google's AdSense denied me there advertising product which is entirely designed with GWT and Google technology because most of my pages where membership oriented. I seriously am a Google promoter but they won't allow me to use there Advertising product in my GoneVertical.com Application so I had to find alternatives.

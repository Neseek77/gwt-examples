#summary advertising in your GWT Application

= Advertising In GWT =
 I wanted other people to know that they have other options if you can't advertise with Google's AdSense. 

 == Why I Use AdBrite ==
 Google's AdSense denied me there advertising product which is entirely designed with GWT and Google technology. I seriously am a Google promoter but they won't allow me to use there Advertising product in my GoneVertical.com Application.
 
 == Need Advertising in Google Code ==
 It would be nice to have advertising in Google Code, for those who spend alot of there time developing and supporting Google Projects! Please :).

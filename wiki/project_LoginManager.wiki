#summary More info on login manager project.

= Login Manger =
 I setup this example to test login manager, to control User access by Username and Password and SessionID. There are many ways you can do this. I followed Google's incubator. You can import my eclipse project or get it via svn. Hope it helps. 
 
 == JDBC ==
 Remember to add JDBC to the build path. More info here [gwtEclipseFaqs]

 == Notes ==

 == Next Version Goal ==
 I have a more advanced version coming in the near future that I have built for another project and will release it here in march. I have been a little to busy to move it all over into its own project.
 
 == MySQL Setup ==
 I will post the mysql scripts for both the user and session tables soon. I am changing the name-space on alot of code to make it easier on the  project.

Session Table - this is how I set it up.
{{{
CREATE TABLE `session` (
  `ID` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
  `UserID` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `SessionID` varchar(200) NOT NULL,
  `LastAccessed` int(11) NOT NULL COMMENT 'unix timestamp',
  `DateCreated` int(11) NOT NULL COMMENT 'unix timestamp',
  PRIMARY KEY  (`ID`),
  KEY `SessionID` (`SessionID`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM AUTO_INCREMENT=18 DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1
}}}

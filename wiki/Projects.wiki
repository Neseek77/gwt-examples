== Import ==
  # You can import these projects into your Eclipse.org IDE. SVN URL: https://gwt-examples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
  # Once imported, change your project's build path to the correct libraries. Change the build path library for gwt-linux home directory. I set mine to /opt/gwt-linux which is linked to the current Google Web toolkit download that I have.

== 32bit JVM ==
Another thing to make a note of. I am using Ubuntu AMD64 and I used galternatives program to change the jvm to a 32bit for runtime. I talk about it in more depth in my code tips blog. More info on galternatives and running a 32bit jvm at runtime. More info here http://codintips.blogspot.com/2007/11/getting-gwt-working-on-ubuntu-amd64.html

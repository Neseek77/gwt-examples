== Project Import ==
  # You can import these projects into your Eclipse.org IDE. SVN URL: http://gwt-examples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
  # Once imported, change your project's build path to the correct libraries. Change the build path library for gwt-linux home directory. I set mine to /opt/gwt-linux which is linked to the current Google Web toolkit download that I have.
  # Open the debug dialog in eclipse and look for java application. Select the gwt application and hit debug.


== JDBC Connector ==
 If you want to use this project's mysql jdbc connector make sure you have it in */opt/gwt-linux*. /opt/gwt-linux/mysql-connector-java-5.0.8-bin.jar
 Or change the build path by right clicking on the eclipse project, select "Build Path", then change or add the mysql jdb connectory library.

== GWT Home Directory ==
 If you want to use my build path from this project install GWT to */opt/gwt-linux*. Or  right click on the eclipse project and select "Build Path", and change the library to the correct location for your GWT Home directory.
 === Setting Enviromental Variable GWT_HOME ===
  If you want to use a enviromental variable
  # Edit /etc/enviroment (sudo gedit /etc/enviroment)
  # Add this
{{{
GWT_HOME="/opt/gwt-linux" 
}}}
  # Or Add it to ~/.profile
{{{
 export GWT_HOME="/opt/gwt-linux" 
}}}
  # Test it in bash/shell
{{{
echo $GWT_HOME
}}}

== 32bit JVM ==
 Another thing to make a note of. I am using Ubuntu AMD64 and I used galternatives program to change the jvm to a 32bit for runtime. I talk about it in more depth in my code tips blog. More info on galternatives and running a 32bit jvm at runtime. More info here [http://codintips.blogspot.com/2007/11/getting-gwt-working-on-ubuntu-amd64.html More @ My Blog Entry]

= Eclipse FAQs =


== Project Import ==
  # You can import these projects into your Eclipse.org IDE. SVN URL: http://gwt-examples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
  # Once imported, change your project's build path to the correct libraries. Change the build path library for gwt-linux home directory. I set mine to /opt/gwt-linux which is linked to the current Google Web toolkit download that I have.
  # Open the debug dialog in eclipse and look for java application. Select the gwt application and hit debug.


== JDBC Connector ==
 If you want to use this project's mysql jdbc connector make sure you have it in */opt/gwt-linux*. /opt/gwt-linux/mysql-connector-java-5.0.8-bin.jar
 Or change the build path by right clicking on the eclipse project, select "Build Path", then change or add the mysql jdb connectory library.
 # Get JConnector MySQL JDBC [http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/5.1.html Link To MySQL]
 # Eclipse > Right Click Project > Build Path > Libraries Tab > Add External Jar > Add /opt/gwt-linux/mysql-connector-java-5.0.8-bin.jar

== GWT Home Directory ==
 If you want to use my build path from this project install GWT to */opt/gwt-linux*. Or  right click on the eclipse project and select "Build Path", and change the library to the correct location for your GWT Home directory.
 === Setting Enviromental Variable GWT_HOME ===
  If you want to use a enviromental variable
  # Edit /etc/enviroment (sudo gedit /etc/enviroment)
  # Add this
{{{
GWT_HOME="/opt/gwt-linux" 
}}}
  # Or Add it to ~/.profile
{{{
 export GWT_HOME="/opt/gwt-linux" 
}}}
  # Test it in bash/shell
{{{
echo $GWT_HOME
}}}


== GWT_EXTERNAL_BROWSER ==

 How to add GWT External Browser envirotmental variable for Eclipse.

 # Edit /etc/enviroment (sudo gedit /etc/enviroment)
 # Add this
{{{
GWT_EXTERNAL_BROWSER="/usr/local/firefox32/firefox"
}}}
 # or add it to ~/.profile (user home directory)
{{{
export GWT_EXTERNAL_BROWSER="/usr/local/firefox32/firefox"
}}}
 # Test it in bash/shell
{{{
echo $GWT_EXTERNAL_BROWSER
}}}

== 32bit JVM ==
 Another thing to make a note of. I am using Ubuntu AMD64 and I used galternatives program to change the jvm to a 32bit for runtime. I talk about it in more depth in my code tips blog. More info on galternatives and running a 32bit jvm at runtime. More info here [http://codintips.blogspot.com/2007/11/getting-gwt-working-on-ubuntu-amd64.html More @ My Blog Entry]

== AMD64 with GWT ==

 Get this error?
{{{
/gwt-linux/libswt-pi-gtk-3235.so: wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS32 (Possible cause: architecture word width mismatch)
}}}

  Error comes from running 64bit java and trying to use 32bit java compiled libraries.

== Changing the default JVM ==

 # Optional: Install sun-java-6-bin and remove gij... (this will replace the with suns java)
 # Install ia32-sun-java6-bin
 # Install galternatives (this is the progam to have for defaults!!!)
 # Run galternatives from shell (don't sudo this, b/c it will change roots defaults and not yours.)
 # Find java in galternatives, choose the default jvm (Find em located in /usr/lib/jvm)
Install as many JVMs as you want to, and choose the one you want to use with galternatives.

{{{
#This is a must have!!
sudo apt-get galternatives

#Another way to do it in shell
#sudo update-alternatives --config java
}}}

If you have the same problem in Eclipse. Configure the JRE. Goto Installed JREs..., Hit Add, and find another jvm in /usr/lib/jvm.
or
In Run > Java Application > Your Application Configuration > JRE > Installed JREs... > (Preferences) Add > /usr/lib/jvm/ia32...jvm

= Game for Warm Beach Camp =
 I built this large scale outdoor game using GWT for the game logic and DMX to control the lighting. Here's some of the story.

== Why ==
 I wanted to donate some fun to Warm Beach Camp [http://warmbeach.com/index.php/lights-of-christmas WarmBeach.com] and in the process learn more. 

== More Work Yet ==
 I still need to do some work so it runs in a standalone mode, but I got by this last year quite well using chrome to run the game.

== Pictures ==

== Source Code ==
 Coming soon, as my eclipse opens the project. I have to dig up the computer and sync the code.

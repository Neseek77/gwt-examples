= Game for Warm Beach Camp =
 I built this large scale outdoor game using GWT for the game logic and DMX to control the lighting. Here's some of the story.
 * [http://lightsforchristmas.appspot.com/ Demo Earlier Game Version] - I built a GAE version, this version still has some UI errors, I had to split b/c of the dmx drivers.
 * [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-examples/source/browse/#svn/trunk/LightsForChristmas/src/org/gonevertical/loc/client Source] - latest source form the Ubuntu computer that runs at the camp.

== Why ==
 I wanted to donate some fun to Warm Beach Camp [http://warmbeach.com/index.php/lights-of-christmas WarmBeach.com] and in the process learn more. 

== More Work Yet ==
 I still need to do some work so it runs in a standalone mode, but I got by this last year quite well using chrome to run the game.

== Pictures ==

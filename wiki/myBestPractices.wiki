#summary List of my best practices

= My Best Practices =
 I wanted to list my best practices here, so I can remember what I do for certain situations that are occurring over and over. This is what I found works best for me. 


= Data Transport =
 Transporting RPC data client to server and server to client. 

 * For example: I fetch data by getting a record from mysql (and its fields/columns), and stick that record (and its field/columns) in a object (or class), to tranpsort to the client through rpc. Having said that, I transport multiple records with making the same object an array. So "MyEmployee employee" or MyEmployee[] emploees.

 Example of an employee object
{{{
// this class has to be on the client side of the code, and it will be imported to the server side
public class EmployeeData implements IsSerializable {
     public int id;
     public String firstname;
     public String lastname;

}
}}}
 
 Array List Example
{{{
public EmployeeData[] getEmployees() {

		String query = "SELECT id,firstname,lastname FROM employee;";

		// prepare for rpc transport
		EmployeeData[] employees = null;

		try {
			Connection connection = getConn();
			Statement select = connection.createStatement();
			ResultSet result = select.executeQuery(query);

			// init object into the size we need, like a recordset
			int rsSize = getResultSetSize(result);
			employees = new EmployeeData[rsSize];

			int i = 0;
			while (result.next()) {

				// init each arrayed object, so we can store data in them
				employees[i] = new EmployeeData();
				employees[i].id = result.getInt(1);
				employees[i].firstname = result.getString(2);
				employees[i].lastname = result.getString(3);

				i++;
			}

			// clean up
			result.close();
			connection.close();

		} catch (SQLException e) {

			System.err.println("Mysql Statement Error: " + query);
			e.printStackTrace();

		}

		// return the array
		return employees;
	}

}
}}}

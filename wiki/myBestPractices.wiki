#summary List of my best practices

= My Best Practices =
 I wanted to list my best practices here, so I can remember what I do for certain situations that are occurring over and over. This is what I found works best for me. 


= Data Transport =
 Tranporting data client to server and server to client. 

* For example: I fetch data by getting a record from mysql (and its fields/columns), and stick that record (and its field/columns) in a object (or class), to tranpsort to the client through rpc. Having said that, I transport multiple records with making the same object an array. So "MyEmployee employee" or MyEmployee[] emploees.

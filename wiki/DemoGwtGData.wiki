= Demo GWT GData =
 The goal is to get access to my documents with my GWT app. The hardest part is the authentication part, but its not as bad as it looks. Its a bit easier than I thought. 

== GData OAuth Authentication (Better) ==
 This time I setup a demo using GData OAuth authentication which was tough at first, because I didn't understand the 3 legged process. Although after finally figuring it out, its quite simple to use. This example demo, shows how the 3 legged process works, saving a token to the JDO data store for use later. I left off checking for a previous token, so it can be tried over and over. I'm impressed how easily the OAuth process actually is now and I am excited to work with it on my larger projects. I didn't sign this demo, so it could look suspicious. I don't do any data collecting other than your google id and authorized token.

 === Important Note - Register Application ===
 This is important, to get a application consumer key and secret, go here: https://www.google.com/accounts/ManageDomains

 === OAuth Popup Window ===
 To setup the token to Google, I use a popup window and servlet to do the 3 steps.

== AuthSub Authentication ==
 Although I thought this would work, oauth is much better.

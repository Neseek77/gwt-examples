#summary Google Code Wants

= My Ideas For Google Code =

 * Add Adsense, like blogspot add element adsense - win win deal for owner/moderator and Google!
 * Add tab for Google Groups for this project
 * Add tab for Google Forums for this project
 * Fix the ? marks that show up when the parser doesn't recognize something.
 * Edit Pages in blocks like wikipedia.
 * Blow up wiki editor window (overlay), nice for bigger resolutions
 * Seperate the HomePage Summary and other blog settings elements to a another tab. Its annoying to not be able to preview hompage/summary before save. Make it show up in the wiki list. Making the homepage/firstpage easier to edit. Maybe allow which wiki page is the first page to show?
 * Demo area (tab) would be really cool, where I could show off the demo

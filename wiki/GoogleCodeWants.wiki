#summary Google Code Wants

= My Ideas For Google Code =

 * Add Adsense, like blogspot add element adsense - win win deal for owner/moderator and Google!
 * Add tab for Google Groups for this project
 * Add tab for Google Forums for this project
 * Fix the ? marks that show up when the parser doesn't recognize something.
 * Edit Pages in blocks like wikipedia.
 * Blow up wiki editor window (overlay) when eidting, like gmail, when composing, nice for bigger resolutions
 * Separate the HomePage Summary (into its own wiki page) and other blog settings elements to a another tab. Its annoying to not be able to preview hompage/summary before save. Make it show up in the wiki list. Making the homepage/firstpage easier to edit. Maybe allow which wiki page is the first page to show?
 * Demo area (tab) would be really cool, where I could show off the demo
 * include code snippet from svn repository into wiki via include tag <include lines='25-50'  file='source/file/file.java'/ >
 * private project would be really cool!
 * this is a dream, but would be nice if you have tomcat server access with project for your GWT projects. For instance i develop a tutorial, it would be cool to upload it to your tomcat server, so I could breg about it. As well it would be popular as well if I could mesh that in with adsense. Overall it would lead to more people coming to your services.
 * Color code wiki code in textarea box, like eclipse IDE would color code, this would help in wiki editing, OR make your own a wiki rich text editor.
 * add apis to ubuntu repository so updater could notify of the latest updates, and could be auto download via repository. (same for rpm repository). Make it easy for developers to stay up with the latest api downloads. Stick the downloads in /opt/Google/api, add link to desktop

== Good Job ==
 * wow, cool svn browsing now!

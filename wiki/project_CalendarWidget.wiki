= CalendarWidget =
 This is more than a date picker to me. So I wrote a DayWidget class to fit inside of every grid, day. This DayWidget observes for clicks and will contain the content that I intend to put in each cell. I used FocusPanel to pick up the clicks on the day number. This is a good example how to use changelisteners to notify widgets of widgets or vica versa.

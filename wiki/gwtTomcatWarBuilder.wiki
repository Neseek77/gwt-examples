#summary gwt Tomcat War Builder

= Tomcat War Builder =
 Compile gwt project for tomcat. Make your rpc happen. Archive, zip up your project in a war file. Deploy it to a tomcat server. I built this script to build my war files for my gwt projects. This helps deploying a project for production testing.

 # Import project or script into eclipse
 # Set Script var  directory like "/home/branflake2267/workspace/gwt-Project";
 # Right click on TomcatWarBuilder.java and Debug as java application
 # Watch Debug Console for notification output
 # Tweak script to your like

		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="left">The Maddy family now owns the farm traditionally
		known as the McCauley farm. Mathew McCauley homesteaded it in 1883.</p>
		<p align="left">Being one of the first settlers on the south fork
		of the Stillaguamish River, he played an intricate part in the
		development of Arlington itself. He was an inspiration to many.</p>
		<p align="left">Mathew's sterling integrity got him elected as
		Arlington's police judge for twenty some years. He was also
		instrumental in forming Arlington's first co-operative creamery, which
		was a real challenge, since so many of the farmers were skeptical and
		did not understand English.</p>
		<p align="left">Upon Mathew's death, his farm was divided between
		his daughter Maude Bowland and son, James McCauley. Maude sold her
		portion of the farm to John and Ann Kazen. They in turn sold the farm
		to their daughter, Evelyn and her husband Dan Hoy in 1948.</p>
		<p align="left">The Hoys sold the farm in 1990 and moved into
		town, where they currently live. They still bring old friends and
		relatives back frequently to see the farm and tell many stories of
		their time of raising a family on the farm. Evelyn has provided a
		clipping from an aged newspaper written by the original settler of the
		claim, Mr. Mathew Marion McCauley.</p>
		<p align="left">The farm exchanged owners twice since the Hoy's
		sold it and today it is owned and loved by the Maddy family and is the
		home of &quot;Bellanova's Coffee.&quot;</p>
